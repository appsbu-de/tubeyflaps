# Tubeyflaps

My contribution for #flappyjam. A Flappy Bird inspired game.

## How to build

This game is being build with my [phaserBoilerplate](https://github.com/appsbu-de/phaserBoilerplate) which is based on grunt.

- Install grunt (http://gruntjs.com)
- run `npm install`

There are two main grunt tasks: `default' and 'build`

### default
Builds a debug-version and opens this version in your default browser. It also starts a `watch` task which monitors file
changes, rebuild and triggers a live reload in your browser.

### build
builds a shipable version of this game into a `dist` directory.

## Disclaimer
I know this game code is far from perfect and I am open for suggestions and talking about. Just get in touch (Twitter: @casarock).
I do not own the assets, nor do I have explicit permission to use them from their creator.

Thanks to *Dong Nguyen* for the insanly great flappy bird!
